# 100DaysOfCode
100DaysOfCode challenge

## Why expand on Alexander Kallaway's #100 Days of Code Challenge? 

Each users account would allow then to: 
* log & track each days progress, rather than have it distrubted over individual twitter feeds
* see other users progress
* track days automatically
* built in tweet to save time updating in only one place per day
* links to other users github repositories
* announce a start day publically
